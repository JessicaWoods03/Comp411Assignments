    " 1. Explain feature and targets\n",
    " \n",
    " Features or variables or attributes are the measured \n",
    " inputs of the problem domain, the independent variables. \n",
    " The target variable is the dependent variable \n",
    "or the measure we're trying to model or forecast. \n",
    " Not all problems can be or need to be formulated in such a way.\n",
    " \n",
    " 2. Whats the difference between supervised learning and unsupervised learning?\n",
    " \n",
    " Unsupervised learning is a machine learning technique, where you do not need to supervise the model. \n",
    " Supervised learning allows you to collect data or produce a data output from the previous experience.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    " 3. Explain classification and regression differences\n",
    " \n",
    " Regression is an algorithm in supervised machine learning that can be trained to \n",
    " predict real number outputs. Classification is an algorithm in supervised \n",
    " machine learning that is trained to identify \n",
    " categories and predict in which category they fall for new values.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am interested in weather predictions, which would be a classification ,\n",
    "I already did a stock predictions\n",
    " which is regression-\n",
    " \n",
    " 4. Describe the roadmap of building a machine learning system?\n",
    " A roadmap that outlines the main stages of building a robust ML \n",
    " program as well as tips for avoiding common ML pitfalls.\n",
    " Preprocessing â€“ getting data into shape\n",
    " Training and selecting a predictive model\n",
    " Evaluating models and predicting unseen data instances\n",
    " \n",
    " 5. In the iris data set explain what are x3, x3, and x33-\n",
    " To refer to single elements in a vector or matrix\n",
    " and x33 = third dimension of flower sample 3\n",
    " one is deminsions and the other is the sample-\n",
    " \n",
    " 6. Let w and x be vectors ...blah blah blah\n",
    " What is wtx?\n",
    " Its about hyperplanes, and making a prediction\n",
